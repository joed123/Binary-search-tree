This program is focused on binary searh trees. It creates a BST and then determines the number of elemnts, inserts values, and removes values. It can also get a value. 
There is also a way to clcuate the height, check for a path sum, and retrive a value assocaqted with a key.
Some of this code (in list.c and test_bst.c) was not written by me.
